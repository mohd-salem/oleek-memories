## Category: Video Compatibility & Conversion

### 7. What video formats does it support?

The device plays **MP4 files with H.264 codec** best. Most modern videos work, but to be safe, we recommend using our [free converter](/convert) to ensure perfect compatibility.

**Supported input formats for conversion:**
MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, WMV, M4V, FLV, WebM

---

### 8. Do I need to convert my videos?

**You should convert if:**
- Your video is 4K or higher resolution
- It's shot at 60fps or higher frame rate
- The file came from a professional videographer (often very large files)
- You're not sure about the format

**You probably don't need to convert if:**
- Your video is already 1080p MP4 from a smartphone
- You've tested it and it plays perfectly on the device

When in doubt, use our [free converter](/convert)—it only takes a few minutes.

---

### 9. Why do you offer a free video converter?

Two reasons:
1. **Better experience for you:** Optimized videos play flawlessly, maximize battery life, and use storage efficiently
2. **Fewer support requests:** Most playback issues are due to incompatible formats—conversion prevents this

Unlike competitors who require you to upload videos to their servers, our converter runs entirely in your browser. Your videos never leave your device, protecting your privacy.

---

### 10. How long does video conversion take?

It depends on your file size and computer speed:
- **Small files (under 500MB):** 5-15 minutes
- **Medium files (500MB - 1GB):** 15-30 minutes
- **Large files (1GB - 2GB):** 30-60 minutes

Conversion happens in your browser using your computer's processor, so a faster computer = faster conversion.

---

### 11. Can I convert videos on my phone?

Currently, the converter works best on desktop computers (Mac or PC) with modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.

Mobile browsers have memory limitations that make converting large video files difficult. We recommend using a laptop or desktop.

---

### 12. What if my video file is huge (over 2GB)?

Files over 2GB may encounter browser memory limits during conversion. 

**Options:**
1. Ask your videographer for a compressed version
2. Use video editing software on your computer to split the file into segments
3. Contact our support team—we can assist with manual conversion for very large files

---

## Category: Using the Device

### 13. How do I load videos onto the device?
