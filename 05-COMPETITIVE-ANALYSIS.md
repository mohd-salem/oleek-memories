**Section 4: Troubleshooting**

*Q: Video shows "NO FILES FOUND" error*

Causes:
- Video format not supported (likely 4K)
- Codec incompatibility
- File corruption

Solutions:
1. Use the Converter tool to re-encode video
2. Ensure video is 1080p or lower
3. Try different video file
4. Contact support if persists

---

*Q: Video plays but stutters or audio is out of sync*

Causes:
- Bitrate too high (device can't process fast enough)
- Frame rate too high (60fps videos)
- Very high quality source

Solutions:
1. **Convert the video** using their tool (primary solution)
2. Manually re-encode to lower bitrate (~5 Mbps)
3. Reduce frame rate to 30fps
4. Lower resolution to 720p

Explanation given:
- Device has limited processing power (not a laptop)
- High bitrate videos demand more resources = stuttering
- Optimized videos play smoothly and save battery

---

Cause:
- Aspect ratio mismatch (video isn't 16:9)

Solutions:
1. Re-encode video with letterboxing (black bars)
2. Use video editing software to add padding
3. Use Converter tool (may handle automatically)

Explanation:
- Device stretches video to fill screen
- Non-16:9 videos (like 4:3 or vertical 9:16) get distorted
- Letterboxing maintains original aspect ratio

---

*Q: Device doesn't show up on my computer*

Causes:
