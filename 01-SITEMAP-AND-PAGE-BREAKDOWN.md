**Category 2: Technical Questions**

**Q: How long can my videos be?**
A: Limited by memory:
- 16GB model: ~3-4 hours total video
- 32GB model: ~8+ hours total video
- Individual files: Keep under 4GB each
- Recommendation: 10-20 minute highlight videos for best viewing experience

**Q: What video formats are supported?**
A: Most standard formats: MP4 (best), MOV, M4V, AVI, WMV, and others. If a video doesn't play, use our [converter tool](/convert).

**Q: What resolution is supported?**
A: Up to 1080p HD. The device cannot play 4K or higher. Videos above 1080p need conversion. 720p works perfectly and saves space.

**Q: What about bitrate and frame rate?**
A: Optimal settings:
- Bitrate: ~5 Mbps (max 8 Mbps)
- Frame rate: 30 fps or lower
High bitrate (>10 Mbps) or 60fps videos may stutter or have sync issues. Our converter optimizes these automatically.

**Q: How is sound quality and volume?**
A: Built-in speakers suitable for personal viewing or small groups in quiet rooms. Volume is adjustable via side buttons. For larger spaces, consider a quiet environment. You can also modify default startup volume (see Learn page).

**Q: Can I add multiple videos or photos?**
A: Yes! Add as many as memory allows. Videos play in sequence automatically. Photos display as slideshow after videos. Add an MP3 file for slideshow background music.

**Q: Can I connect to a TV?**
A: No video output (HDMI, etc.). It's a standalone display designed as a portable keepsake. To watch on TV, use the video file itself with your TV's media player.

**Q: Does it come with a protective case?**
A: Ships in a sturdy gift box. The linen hardcover protects the screen when closed. No separate carrying case included (not currently offered as accessory).

**Q: Can I charge while playing?**
A: Yes, plug in via USB while playing. Useful for extended viewing sessions (battery alone lasts ~8 hours).
