## Section 1: Loading Videos (Step-by-Step)

### Getting Started

Your OLEEK Memories Book works like a USB flash drive. If you can drag and drop files, you can load your wedding videos.

**What you'll need:**
- Your OLEEK Memories Book
- The included USB cable
- A computer (Mac or PC)
- Your video file(s)—ideally converted using our [free converter](/convert)

---

### Step 1: Charge Your Device (First Time Only)

Before loading videos, make sure your Memories Book is fully charged.

**How to charge:**
1. Connect the USB cable to the charging port on the side of the device
2. Plug into a USB power adapter (like your phone charger) or computer
3. The indicator light will show red while charging, green when complete
4. First charge takes about 3-4 hours

*You don't need to charge it every time you load videos—just ensure it has some battery.*

---

### Step 2: Connect to Your Computer

**For both Mac and PC:**
1. Close the Memories Book cover
2. Connect the included USB cable to the device
3. Connect the other end to your computer's USB port
4. Wait 10-15 seconds for your computer to recognize the device

**What you should see:**
- **Mac:** A drive icon appears on your desktop labeled "OLEEK" or "MEMORIES_BOOK"
- **PC:** A notification appears saying "USB Device Ready" and a new drive appears in File Explorer

**If nothing appears:**
- Try a different USB port
- Try a different cable (use a data cable, not a charging-only cable)
- Restart your computer and try again
- Ensure the device has some battery charge

---

### Step 3: Open the Device Folder

**Mac:**
- Double-click the drive icon on your desktop
- You'll see a folder structure, possibly named "DCIM" or "Videos"

**PC:**
- Open File Explorer (Windows key + E)
- Click on the OLEEK drive under "This PC"
- You'll see a folder, likely "DCIM" or "Videos"

**What if I don't see a folder?**
- Create a new folder called "Videos" at the root level of the drive
- This is where you'll place your files

---

### Step 4: Copy Your Video Files

**Drag and drop method:**
1. Open the folder where your converted video is saved
2. Drag the video file into the OLEEK device folder
3. Wait for the file to finish copying (watch the progress bar)

**Copy-paste method:**
1. Right-click your video file and select "Copy"
2. Navigate to the OLEEK device folder
3. Right-click inside the folder and select "Paste"

**How long does copying take?**
- A 2GB video typically takes 2-5 minutes to copy
- A 10GB video might take 10-20 minutes
- Speed depends on your USB port (USB 3.0 is faster than USB 2.0)

**Multiple videos:**
You can load multiple video files. The device will play them in alphabetical order by filename. To control playback order, rename your files:
- `01_ceremony.mp4`
- `02_reception.mp4`
- `03_speeches.mp4`

---

### Step 5: Safely Eject the Device

**This step is important!** Don't just unplug the cable—you could corrupt your files.

**Mac:**
- Right-click the OLEEK drive icon and select "Eject"
- Wait for the icon to disappear from your desktop
- Then unplug the USB cable

**PC:**
- Click the "Safely Remove Hardware" icon in your system tray (bottom-right)
- Select "Eject OLEEK" or "Eject MEMORIES_BOOK"
- Wait for the "Safe to Remove Hardware" message
- Then unplug the USB cable

---

### Step 6: Test Playback

1. Disconnect from your computer
2. Ensure the device is charged (at least 20% battery)
3. Open the cover
4. Your video should start playing automatically within 2-3 seconds

**If the video doesn't play:**
- Close and reopen the cover
- Make sure the video file is in the correct folder
- Try pressing the small play/pause button (if your model has one)
- Verify the video plays on your computer first
- See troubleshooting section below

## Section 2: Best Video Settings

### What Makes a Great Video for Your Device?

The OLEEK Memories Book is designed for 1080p HD video. Here are the optimal settings:

**Resolution:**
- **Ideal:** 1080p (1920×1080)
- **Acceptable:** 720p (1280×720) or 1080p
- **Avoid:** 4K or higher (wastes storage and battery)

**Aspect Ratio:**
- **Best:** 16:9 (widescreen)—fits perfectly on the screen
- **Acceptable:** 4:3 (older cameras)—will have black bars on sides
- **Vertical video:** Not recommended—will have large black bars

**Frame Rate:**
- **Best:** 30 fps (frames per second)
- **Acceptable:** 24 fps (cinematic) or 30 fps
- **Avoid:** 60 fps or higher (drains battery, no visible benefit on this screen)

**File Format:**
- **Best:** MP4 with H.264 codec
- **Also works:** Most modern formats (use our converter to be safe)
- **Avoid:** Very old formats (WMV, AVI from 2000s)

**Audio:**
- **Best:** AAC codec, 128 kbps
- **Built-in speakers:** Surprisingly good quality, enough to fill a room
- **Headphone jack:** Available if you want private listening

---

### How Long Can My Videos Be?

**Storage capacity determines total time:**

**16GB model:**
- Approximately 6-8 hours of optimized video
- Example: Full ceremony (1 hour) + reception highlights (2 hours) + multiple short clips

**32GB model:**
- Approximately 12-15 hours of optimized video
- Example: Entire wedding day footage (4 hours) + rehearsal dinner + getting ready footage + highlight reels

**File size estimates:**
- 1 hour of 1080p video at 5 Mbps = ~2.25 GB
- 30 minutes of 720p video = ~1 GB
- 5 minute highlight reel = ~300 MB

---

### Should I Convert My Videos?

**You should convert if:**
- ✓ Your video is 4K or higher resolution
- ✓ It's shot at 60fps or higher
- ✓ The file size is massive (over 5GB for 1 hour of video)
- ✓ It won't play when you test it on the device
- ✓ You want to maximize storage space and battery life

**You probably don't need to convert if:**
- Your video is already 1080p MP4 from a smartphone
- It plays smoothly on your device
- File size seems reasonable (2-3GB per hour)

**When in doubt:** Use our [free converter](/convert). It only takes a few minutes and ensures perfect compatibility.

## Section 3: Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Not Safely Ejecting the Device

**Problem:** Unplugging the USB cable without ejecting can corrupt your video files.

**Solution:** Always use the "Safely Remove Hardware" (PC) or "Eject" (Mac) option before unplugging.

**How to tell if files are corrupted:**
- Video won't play on the device
- File size shows as 0 bytes
- Error message when trying to open on computer

**Fix:** Delete the corrupted file, reconnect, and copy again.

---

### Mistake #2: Letting the Battery Fully Drain

**Problem:** Like any rechargeable device, fully draining the battery repeatedly can reduce its lifespan.

**Solution:** Charge the device when it reaches 20-30% battery rather than waiting for it to die.

**Battery life expectations:**
- 8 hours continuous playback when new
- 1+ year of standby time between charges
- Gradually decreases over 2-3 years (normal for all rechargeable batteries)

---

### Mistake #3: Using Incompatible Video Formats

**Problem:** Loading videos that aren't in the right format results in "No Files Found" or playback errors.

**Solution:** Always convert videos using our [free converter](/convert) if you're unsure about format compatibility.

**Signs your format is incompatible:**
- Device shows "No Files Found" even though you copied files
- Video plays but has no sound
- Video freezes or stutters
- Only shows a black screen

---

### Mistake #4: Filling Storage to 100%

**Problem:** Filling the device completely can cause playback issues and slow performance.

**Solution:** Leave at least 500MB-1GB of free space.

**How to check storage:**
- Connect to computer
- Right-click the drive and select "Properties" (PC) or "Get Info" (Mac)
- Look at "Used" vs "Available" space

---

### Mistake #5: Cleaning the Screen Incorrectly

**Problem:** Using harsh cleaners or rough materials can scratch the screen.

**Solution:** 
- Use a soft microfiber cloth (like for eyeglasses)
- Lightly dampen with water if needed
- Never use alcohol, ammonia, or window cleaner
- Never spray liquid directly on the device

---

### Mistake #6: Expecting Instant Device Recognition

**Problem:** Some computers take 10-30 seconds to recognize a newly connected USB device.

**Solution:** Be patient. Wait at least 30 seconds before troubleshooting. Some older computers are slower to detect devices.

---

### Mistake #7: Uploading RAW Video Files

**Problem:** Professional videographers often deliver "RAW" or uncompressed video files that are enormous (20-50GB for 1 hour).

**Solution:** Ask your videographer for "web-optimized" or "1080p delivery" versions. Or use our converter to compress them.

**Why it matters:**
- RAW files fill up your device with just one video
- They drain battery much faster
- Often won't play at all due to unsupported codecs

---

## Section 4: Device Care & Maintenance

### Keeping Your Memories Book in Great Condition

**Daily use:**
- Handle by the edges (avoid touching the screen)
- Keep away from extreme temperatures (don't leave in hot car)
- Close cover gently (the auto-play sensor is delicate)

**Storage:**
- Store in a cool, dry place
- Keep away from direct sunlight (can fade the linen cover)
- Don't stack heavy items on top

**Cleaning:**
- Screen: Microfiber cloth, dry or slightly damp
- Cover: Soft brush to remove dust
- Ports: Compressed air can to remove debris (gently)

**Battery care:**
- Charge every 3-6 months even if not using
- Don't leave plugged in for weeks at a time
- Use the included cable or a high-quality USB cable

---

## Section 5: Troubleshooting

### "No Files Found" Error

**Possible causes:**
1. Videos are in the wrong folder
