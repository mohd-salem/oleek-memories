## Intro Explanation Section

### Why Convert Your Videos?

The OLEEK Memories Book plays videos best when they're in a specific format. Most videos from professional videographers, smartphones, and cameras need optimization.

**Common issues with unconverted videos:**
- 4K or high-resolution files that exceed the device's screen resolution
- High frame rates (60fps or 120fps) that drain battery unnecessarily
- Large file sizes that fill up storage quickly
- Incompatible codecs that won't play at all
- Unusual aspect ratios that don't fit the screen properly

Our converter fixes all of this automatically.

## Privacy Statement Section

### Your Privacy is Our Priority

**Your videos never leave your computer.**

Unlike other conversion services that require you to upload your files to a server, our tool processes everything locally in your web browser. 

**What this means:**
- No uploading or downloading (beyond the converted file)
- We never see, access, or store your videos
- No account required, no email needed
- Works offline after the tool loads
- Your intimate wedding moments stay private

**How it works technically:**  
We use WebAssembly technology to run video conversion software directly in your browser. The entire process happens in your computer's memory. When conversion is complete, the file downloads to your device and nothing is retained.

## Tips for Best Results

### Before You Convert

**✓ Check your original file quality**  
Make sure your source video plays correctly on your computer first.

**✓ Close unnecessary browser tabs**  
Video conversion uses significant memory. Give it room to work.

**✓ Plug in your laptop**  
Conversion is processor-intensive and can drain battery.

**✓ Be patient**  
Conversion time varies based on your computer's speed and the file size. A 1-hour 4K video might take 30+ minutes on an average laptop.

### After Conversion

**✓ Test the file**  
Play the converted video on your computer to verify it looks and sounds correct.

**✓ Keep your original**  
Don't delete your source video. The converted version is optimized for the device, but you should keep the highest-quality original.

**✓ Load multiple videos**  
You can convert and load multiple videos to create a full wedding day playlist.
